# DATA-ANALYSIS-WITH-COMPLEX-QUERIES
**COMPANY**: CODETECH IT SOLUTIONS

**NAME**: HEMAKSHI INGALE

**INTERN ID**: CT08KXN

**DOMAIN**: SQL

**BATCH DURATION**: JANUARY 10th TO FEBRUARY 10th, 2025

**MENTOR NAME**: NEELA SANTOSH KUMAR

This repository contains SQL scripts and analysis reports that showcase advanced data analysis using complex queries. The objective of this task is to identify trends and patterns in a dataset through the effective use of window functions, subqueries, and common table expressions (CTEs). By employing these advanced SQL techniques, this project demonstrates the power of relational databases in handling large datasets and extracting meaningful insights.

# Overview of the Project
The task involves creating a database and performing complex queries on it, aimed at analyzing product sales and performance. The analysis is performed using modern SQL techniques, ensuring that the queries are optimized and follow best practices.

The repository provides step-by-step SQL scripts to:

Create and populate the database with sample data.
Analyze patterns such as cumulative sales, top-performing products, and detailed transaction data.
Present the results in the form of structured reports.
The project is designed to enhance proficiency in SQL and is particularly relevant for data analysts, database administrators, and students learning advanced database concepts.

# Key Features

Database Creation and Population:

A sample database, AdvancedDataAnalysis, was created to simulate real-world product sales data.
Two tables, Sales and Products, were created with attributes such as ProductID, Revenue, SaleDate, and product names.
Advanced SQL Techniques:

**Window Functions**: Used for ranking products, calculating running totals, and summarizing data over partitions.
CTEs (Common Table Expressions): Simplified complex queries by breaking them into smaller, readable steps.

**Subqueries**: Nested queries were used to calculate intermediate results for further analysis.

# Insights Generated:

Top-performing products by revenue.
Cumulative sales trends over time.
Detailed performance analysis for each product.

# Libraries and Platforms Used
Libraries:

**SQL**: The core language used for database management and querying.
**MySQL Functions**: Built-in MySQL functions like RANK(), SUM(), and OVER() were extensively used.

Platforms:

**MySQL 8.0**: This version of MySQL supports window functions and CTEs, making it ideal for this task.
MySQL Workbench: Used for writing and executing queries in an intuitive graphical interface.

**Command Line Interface (CLI)**: For direct interaction with the MySQL server, especially when automating tasks.
**GitHub**: The repository is hosted on GitHub for version control and collaboration.

# Resources:

**Official MySQL Documentation**: For understanding the syntax and usage of advanced SQL features.
Online learning platforms like W3Schools, GeeksforGeeks, and Stack Overflow for troubleshooting and learning.

# Future Enhancements
This project can be further extended by:

Integrating visualization tools like Tableau or Power BI to graphically represent the insights.
Automating the analysis using Python scripts with libraries like pymysql or SQLAlchemy.
Adding real-world datasets to expand the analysis and showcase more complex scenarios.

This repository serves as a valuable resource for understanding and applying advanced SQL concepts in data analysis. It highlights the importance of database management systems in deriving actionable insights from structured data.
